# WIP OpenAPI Spec for Bluesky/AT Protocol

This is a very early draft of an OpenAPI spec for the AT Protocol native server API and the API for the Bluesky
social media network, which run on atproto. Both APIs are in active development and are rapidly changing, so this spec
may be often out of date, although I will try to keep it updated as much as possible. 

Collaborators welcome. If you see and error or want to improve the spec, fork this project and then make a pull request.
